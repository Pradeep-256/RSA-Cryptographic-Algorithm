# RSA-Cryptographic-Algorithm
Simplified RSA cryptosystem implemented in Verilog HDL. The design performs modular exponentiation for encryption (P⁷ mod 33) and decryption (C³ mod 33) using iterative multiplication. Dual-port RAM is used for plaintext and ciphertext storage. Synthesizable and suitable for FPGA-based academic demonstration of hardware cryptography concepts.
